# sl-scrape
## Overview
Developing advanced neural network tasks, such as [gaze-tracking](https://github.com/majewski00/gaze-tracking), demands significant computational resources. Overcoming the challenge of limited resources, I've crafted a scraping bot in selenium dedicated to monitoring GPU availability on the [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com) website. This bot operates seamlessly on a Raspberry Pi, ensuring continuous monitoring. Control is facilitated through a local website hosted on the same device, enabling efficient management of cloud GPU resources.
